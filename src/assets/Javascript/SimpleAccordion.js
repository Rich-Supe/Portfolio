            I graduated from college in Chicago and continued to work in the restaurant industry as an operations manager. 
            While I enjoyed the job, my heart was in tech so I joined App Academy's 1400 hour immersive boot-camp to 
            sharpen my coding skills from front to back with different stacks.
